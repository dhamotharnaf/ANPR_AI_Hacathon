# ANPR_AI_Hacathon 

This repository was created as a result of participation in an AI Hackathon held at my institution in which I got second place in it.

If you run **Main.py** it will perform Vehicle Classification, Tracking, Number Plate Detection and Recognition, and Speed Detection as well. In conclusion, it's an allrounder
I've also coded to capture the image of the vehicle which crosses the speed limit.

You can change the speed limit if you want and if you are going to give any different dataset [Video] Change Y_a, Y_b, Y_c, Y_d [these variables are present in this **tracker_Classifier_Speed_Detect.py**] according to your frame and video because in some videos the cars will be going away and in some videos, they will be approaching the camera.

**Upload.py** is to update in Database or in CSV file format that has not been integrated, if you want you can use it

If you want to increase the resolution of the image you can you ESRGAN by Google TensorFlowHub https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/image_enhancing

If your Device Specifications are lower you can use the Jupyter notebook file main.ipynb [everything is there in that file too]
